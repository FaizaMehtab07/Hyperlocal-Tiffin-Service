# Hyperlocal Tiffin Service

A Streamlit-based platform designed to help users discover, explore, and review nearby Tiffin & Mess services. Inspired by apps like Zomato & Swiggy, this system is tailored for hyperlocal, homemade, and authentic food options within the city.

## Project Idea

* Verified Tiffin & Mess services
* Home-style meals with dietary options
* Transparent reviews and ratings
* Hyperlocal availability within defined areas
